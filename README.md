<strong>Known issue:</strong>

In Firefox, the CSS function "conic-gradient" is not supported.<br>
Using "svg" as fallback for the outer-circle, with a lower z-index, so that it's hidden in browsers where "conic-gradient" is supported.<br>
Calculations below adapted from:<br>

C (circumference) = 2 * Ï€ * R<br>
R = 115<br>
C ~= 722.5663<br>

dasharray for the "breathein" and "breatheout" circles:<br>
1st value = dash = 2/5 * C = 289.0265<br>
2nd value = gap = C = 722.5663<br>

dashoffset (negative) for the "breatheout" circle:<br>
offset = -3/5 * C = -433.5397<br>

dasharray for the "hold" circle:<br>
1st value = dash = 1/5 * C = 144.5132<br>
2nd value = gap = C = 722.5663<br>

dashoffset (negative) for the "hold" circle:<br>
offset = -2/5 * C = -289.0265<br>
